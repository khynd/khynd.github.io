<!-- The footer element features 2 uses of IDs: the first is to create a rounded edge on the bottom two corners to be 
		cohesive with the header, and the second is used in the p tag to override an issue I was having where the section
		stopped being centered when I changed the p style in css. 
		I decided to use the footer as a source statement.
